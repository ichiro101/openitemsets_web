<h1>Getting Started</h1>

<p>Scroll down below for the Desktop Client download.</p>

<h4>Register an Account</h4>
<p>Before you get started with Open Item Sets, it is recommended that you register an account. Once
you have an account, you can create your own item sets, or subscribe to item sets created by other
players.</p>

<h4>Download the Desktop Client</h4>
<p>
Once you have created an account, you will need to download the Desktop Client. Our Desktop Client
will ensure that the item sets on your computer will stay in sync with the item sets you subscribe
to or created. Once you installed the desktop client, the desktop client will prompt for your League
of Legends installation folders and username. Your username is the name that is displayed on the
top right corner of the site if you are viewing this site from a PC. 
</p>

<h4>Creating Your First Item Set</h4>
<p>
To create an item set, click on "Browse Item Sets" on the top of the page, and then click on
"Create Item Set". You will be prompted for the title, champion and position. Once that's done
you can start editing your own item set via our drag and drop interface.
</p>

<h4>Subscribing to Other Player's Item Sets</h4>
<p>
While browsing item sets created by other people, you may wish to subscribe to their item sets. Simply
click the "Subscribe" button on the bottom of the item set details.
</p>


<h3>Important Note</h3>
<p>
Item sets created by Open Item Sets will not show up on the Item Sets tab in the profile window. It
is stored seperately and will show up ingame, so don't worry if it doesn't show up in the game lobby
client.
